My solutions to daily Codewars challenges. These are done as a way to test and refine my skills and implement any new techniques I may have learnt in my studies.

## HOW IT'S MADE
**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

As I'm currently stydying JavaScript all problems will be solved using that language but I hope to utilise more languages as my skills develop.
